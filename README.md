# Password Manager
## Purpose
A simple password manager where you can generate strong passwords and save them in your account.
This project, at least for now, is for learning purpose, maybe will release it on play store.

## Usage
Clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:PedroKaram/Password-manager.git`

At the login screen I set up a global user:
```
username: user
password: pass
```
