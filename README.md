# Password Manager
## Purpose
A simple password manager where you can generate strong passwords and save them in your account.
This project, at least for now, is for learning purpose, maybe will release it on play store.

## Usage
Clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:PedroKaram/Password-manager.git`

At the login screen I set up a global user:
```
username: user
password: pass
```

## Intended Updates by level of importance
## Highly Important

- Add feature to register a new password
- Show passwords list on `MyPasswordsActivity`
- - Create local database to save user's passwords
- Encrypt passwords before sending to database
- Ask phone's password to show the selected password

## Not Important for now

- Learn a frontend framework to make it prettier
